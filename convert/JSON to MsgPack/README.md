# Serialize JSON to MessagePack data

Author: craftysecurity

Workflow to serialize JSON to MessagePack data.

## IMPORTANT 
The MessagePack binary format cannot be reliably copy and pasted as it contains non-printable characters and binary data that text editors and clipboards do not support properly. You should use 'replace' feature instead so the binary data is directly placed into caido intact.
