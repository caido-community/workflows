# Compress to GZIP 

Author: craftysecurity

Workflow to compress data to gzip for linux using shell and pyton.

### Requirements
pip3 install gzip

# Important
The gzip data format cannot be reliably copy and pasted as it contains non-printable characters and binary data that text editors and clipboards do not support properly. You should use 'replace' feature instead so the binary data is directly placed into caido intact.
