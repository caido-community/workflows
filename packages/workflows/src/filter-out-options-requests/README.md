# Filter Out OPTIONS Requests

This workflow filters out HTTP OPTIONS requests from the proxy history view, reducing noise and helping focus on more actionable HTTP traffic.

## Features

- Filters out all HTTP OPTIONS requests
- Highlights remaining requests in green for visibility
- Reduces noise in proxy history
- Helps focus on actionable HTTP methods

## Usage

This passive workflow runs automatically on all HTTP traffic. It will:

1. Check if the HTTP method is NOT OPTIONS
2. If the request uses any method other than OPTIONS, highlight it in green
3. OPTIONS requests are effectively filtered out from view

## About OPTIONS Requests

HTTP OPTIONS requests are used to:
- Check which HTTP methods are allowed for a resource
- Handle CORS preflight requests
- Discover server capabilities

While OPTIONS requests serve important purposes, they often create noise in security testing as they:
- Don't contain application logic
- Are automatically generated by browsers for CORS
- Rarely contain vulnerabilities themselves

## Use Cases

This filter is particularly useful when:
- Analyzing web application traffic
- Focusing on actionable HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Reducing clutter in proxy history during testing
- Concentrating on requests that modify application state
