# Queryfinder

 Author: Chriscz

## This workflow identifies HTTP requests where the URL includes a query(?), indicating the presence of query parameters. It helps to flag any requests that carry parameters in their URLs for further inspection or filtering.

This can be fine tuned to be better for more specfic filtering by editing the nodes in the workflows tab if you installed it
